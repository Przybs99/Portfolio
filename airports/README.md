This is my personal portfolio of data analysis projects

1. Airports - this is the analysis of almost a 100 US airports and the delays of the flights that took place. I tried to do every step of data analysis workflow so: Data collection, preparation, analysis and visualization

In this project I tried to show my skills in above mentioned topics. I learned how to look for answers to the problems I had along the way and how to use the knowledge I gained during my education.

I used jupyter notebook extension in Visual Studio Code.
